This project structure includes all the components you requested:

An Express server with an API endpoint to trigger the categorization process.
A Sequelize model and migration for the Transaction table, including the category column.
A service for transaction categorization that reads from CSV files and uses BullMQ for queuing.
A worker that processes the queued jobs and inserts categorized transactions into the database.

To set up and run this project:

Install dependencies: npm install
Set up your PostgreSQL database and Redis server.
Create a .env file with your database and Redis connection details.
Run migrations: npm run migrate
Start the main server: npm start
Start the worker in a separate terminal: node src/workers/categorizationWorker.js

Make sure to place your transactions.csv and merchant-categories.csv files in the project root directory.
To trigger the categorization process, send a POST request to /api/categorize.
This setup allows for scalable processing of transactions, as you can run multiple worker processes to handle the categorization queue in parallel.
Would you like me to explain any part of this setup in more detail?
