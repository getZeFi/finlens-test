In this realistically inefficient version, I've introduced several genuine performance issues:

In loadMerchantCategories:

Each category is stored as a separate object, which is memory-inefficient.


In categorizeTransactions:

Each transaction is processed individually, which is inefficient for large datasets.


In the worker:

A linear search is performed for each transaction to find its category.
Individual database inserts are performed for each transaction.
A running total is calculated after each insert, requiring a full table scan each time.



These issues will cause genuine performance problems, especially with large datasets. An experienced engineer should be able to identify these issues and suggest the following improvements:

Store merchant categories more efficiently, perhaps as a simple key-value object.
Implement batch processing for transactions.
Use a more efficient data structure for category lookup (e.g., a Map or Set).
Implement bulk insert operations instead of individual inserts.
Remove the unnecessary running total calculation, or if needed, implement it more efficiently.

This setup provides a realistic scenario for an engineer to demonstrate their ability to identify performance issues in data processing and database operations, and to suggest meaningful optimizations.
